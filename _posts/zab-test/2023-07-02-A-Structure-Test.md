There is no perfect time ~ there only ***is*** ~  you can only ***be***

- And with that, for my first post, I'd like to focus on Apple Gaming... 🍎
- The second post... a focus on the concept of containerization 📦 > why it matters in the market > along with 3 examples of demo projects for you to try @ home...
- And my third post on useful MacOS and Linux Commands to have ready at the hip 💾

I'd like to thank Sean Pratt for always being able to bounce ideas off of, Miriam Benitez for being the light to guide my way ~ for being a bright example of bravery and tenacity, Jose Claudio for sharing wisdom beyond his years, and Ekatrina Makarova for showing me the tenacity and curiosity to make it through this world.

Additionally, I'd like to thank Jeff Gerstmann (no, I don't know him) for showing me so clearly what it means to commit and embrace the chaos.
